/**
 * Games we cover before they ship.
 *
 * Why this list is curated by hand: the catalogue is built from SteamSpy
 * ownership, and an unreleased game has no owners, so upcoming titles are
 * invisible to that pipeline no matter how much they are being discussed.
 * These are the ones worth a page early — a game's requirements page has
 * almost no competition months before launch.
 *
 * Only `appid` drives the fetch. Everything shown on the site (name, date,
 * publisher, requirements) comes from that game's Steam page via
 * scripts/fetch-upcoming.mjs — nothing here is typed by hand, so nothing here
 * can go stale or be wrong.
 *
 * `buzz` is only set where a named source ranked the game, and it is rendered
 * with that source next to it. No invented hype.

/* Each claim is worded as its source words it, and links the page that says
